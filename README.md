# Colored SWLM Blocks Borders
At the suggestion from **Redzeal** In the SWEM Beta discord, I have made a quick fix. Redzeal requested that SWLM blocks appear different from the normal base block they match. Thankfully thereâ€™s a mod out there that fixes this for us.
**AlaharranHonor** has given us a final config file that has all 3 SWLM branding colors 

## Required Mods
1. [Iceberg](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iceberg)  
2. [Item Borders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/item-borders) 
3. [Star Worm Lighting Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/swlm) 

## Installing This
Just take the file you've downloaded from this repository and dump it into your config file.
I have turned off the rarity highlighting, so this config just highlights SWLM blocks! If you would like to add it back in, follow the directions outlined in Choosing A Color. :)

## Choosing A Color
So you downloaded the file from this repository, open it in a text editor. This is completely optional, but by default SWLM blocks will be highlighted in Light Green. The config file displays all the codes for the colors shown below.
